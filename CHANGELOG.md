# Changelog
## v3.0.0

- Tested with WSL2 (no changes required). Didn't encounter any issues, let me know if you do
- Dendency updates

No breaking changes in wsl-path, but I updated the libraries, which reported some. I rather play
safe and go for a major update here. 

## v2.0.0

- Detect mount points and allow custom default mount paths (not in /mnt/c/) in wsl environment
